# About this Course

A little over two decades ago, Tim Berners-Lee changed the internet when he proposed and wrote an Internet-based hypertext system. This language or system turned into the HTML that we know today. Since, its introduction over 20 years ago, HTML has taken over as a de facto language to create webpages.

It is commonly used along with two other prominent technologies, CSS and JavaScript. The two technologies are used to change the layout of the webpage and also alter its aesthetics. HTML5 and CSS3 are the latest versions of the older technologies and offer newer features that makes it easier for developers to code.

With so many benefits, it is no wonder that HTML5 and CSS3 are the first technologies that developers turn to when trying to create webpages. This tutorial will teach you how use LESS, a CSS pre-processor by showing you how to create a clean and elegant newsletter. It will also touch base on other technologies such as Node.js Installation, Installing, Configuring and Working with LESS.
